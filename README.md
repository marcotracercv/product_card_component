## My process

### Built with

In this challenge I was focus on trying and practice with new features for me ^^ !!...

- GULP
- SASS (with 7:1 architecture)
- BEM CSS

\*gulp helps me on automate workflow on repetitive tasks like compress images, convertion of different formats, compile sass, and many others... it is really helpful!!

\*sass is so fun to use, really helpful when styling with pure css and makes it more confortable to work with, it has a lot of features to try and helps you to use css like another programming languaje!!

\*BEM is basically the css methodology!! makes it look more organize, readable, and reusable. ThereÂ´s more like SMACSS and OOCSS, but BEM is by far the most common.

FEEL FREE TO COMMENT ANYTHING ABOUT THE RESULT OR SUGGEST!! ^^
